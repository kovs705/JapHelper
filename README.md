# JapHelper
iOS App project, written with SwiftUI framework. Needs *LOTS* of work.

The main purpose of JapHelper app is to be a helpful and easy to use *reference book*. 
People that learn Japanese will have grammar, placed by categories (N5, N4, N3, N2 and N1), ability to make groups with words and *maybe* I could finally understand how to work with *JMDict* (Japanese Dictionary)

Right now I'm using **SwiftUI** (2 I guess) and it still has lots of bugs but I really want to try out this way of buidling app.

Okay so here is the list of problems(?):
- Grammar requires *TONS OF WORK*: 
  - formating every lesson by levels of **JLPT** and placing it in JSON document (right now I have some problems with json in Xcode 12, maybe I have to update it :/)
  - understand how I could place a JMDict dictionary into my app
  - this list will update soon..
- Design also needs to be changed:
  - from changing the size of the text to animations
  - actually it is just UI and UX, haha
  
 As you can understand, right now i'm not working on this project, so it would be better rebuilding it and creating a new repository, but with Stroyboard and with corrected mistakes.
